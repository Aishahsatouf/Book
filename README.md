Book tracker web app made with Spring Boot and React (Typescript).

*The image above is from the mockup designs, so this may look slightly different to the app. If major changes are made, we will upload a new image.*

## Setup

Prerequisites:
- JDK 11
- Node >= 10 for React


As Docker is our recommended approach, our instructions will assume you're following this route.

First, clone the repository (you'll need to fork first and then clone your fork if you're contributing).
 
### Running the frontend

1. Navigate to the `Book/` directory
2. Run `npm install` to install the dependencies
3. Run `npm start` to start the development server
4. Open `localhost:3000`

## Preview
